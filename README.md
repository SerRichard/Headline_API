# **BBC news headline scraper**

Simple backend for an App that scrapes headlines, summaries and dates daily.
It will print the updates as retrieved and add them to a csv. Furhter development
could be to build an API, add a GUI, and to make the file an executable. 

# Preparation

Pull from repository
```
sudo wget -O requirements.txt
sudo wget -O bbc_scrape.py
```

Install
```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo python3 bbc_scrape.py
```

Now the app runs and will provide you with updates daily!
